Advice for Bodhibhadra: A Supplication Prayer Connected to the Graded Path of Precious Teachings Indivisible from all the conquerors and their heirs, Mañjughoṣa and the others, You have discovered timeless awareness imbued with wisdom and love. Glorious lama, learned and accomplished sovereign, I supplicate you from the bottom of my heart-please grant your blessings! Please grant your blessings to see all realms of saṃsāra as trenches of fire, To realize that the freedoms and advantages are difficult to obtain and the time of death is uncertain, To grasp deeply that the consequences of actions are inevitable, And to exert myself properly in adopting and letting go. Please grant your blessings to train in love, compassion, and aspiring and applied bodhicitta, To enter and emerge from the tranquil ocean of samādhi, To perfect the profound wisdom of vipaśyanā, And to see simplicity, the underlying nature beyond constructs. Please grant your blessings to be ripened by empowerment and have completely pure samaya, To realize the continuum of the ground, the view of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as indivisible, To actualize the continuum of the path, the wisdom of the two stages, And to accomplish the continuum of fruition, the four kāyas. In brief, from now until the essence of awakening, Please grant your blessings so that I am accepted by the venerable lama and never separate from him, All obstacles are pacified, all thoughts and deeds are in accord with the Dharma, And the twofold benefit is spontaneously accomplished! The bhikṣu and virtuous spiritual guide Bodhibhadra expressed a need for a presentation such as this. As requested, with the condensed stages of the path of the precious oral teachings as a theme, this supplication prayer connected to points of training was composed by the renunciate Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. May it be beneficial!
